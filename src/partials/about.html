      <p class="paragraph about__paragraph">Now, I'm working at a company <a href="https://www.pult.ru/" target="_blank" class="about__link">Pult.ru</a>. My main job is to create landing pages and promotion pages that are adaptive and cross-browsered. But I also create new blocks and features, such as tooltips, sliders, feedback blocks. Actually, I try to make as many small tasks as I can, so our developers focus on big stuff.</p>
